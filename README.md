# Durandal Navigation Service

A simple library written in TypeScript for managing the navigation in Durandal. This navigation service is made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
